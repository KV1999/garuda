run our sim
    ros2 launch garuda launch_sim.launch.py world:=./src/garuda/worlds/obstacles.world 
    killall gzserver and killall gzclient

ROS2_control
Let’s try the spawner script.

    ros2 run controller_manager spawner.py diff_cont
    ros2 run controller_manager spawner.py joint_broad

    sudo apt install ros-humble-ros2-control ros-humble-ros2-controllers ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control
    ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r /cmd_vel:=/diff_cont/cmd_vel_unstamped

    It works with Ubuntu 22.04 Humble and you should install all control package such as joint_trajectory_controller, joint_state_broadcaster, controller_manager, joint-state-publisher-gui then edit your launch file.

Hello there,

Thanks @gurselturkeri, for updating the launch file in the question, but I am sharing the details answer over here,

    As @gurselturkeri suggested to installed joint_trajectory_controller, joint_state_broadcaster, controller_manager, joint-state-publisher-gui library.

I think you also need this below library to access gazebo controls. sudo apt-get install ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control

    About the Launch file, If you are using Ros2 Humble you need to correct

Check Which command is working in your case After installing controller-manager hit this commands in terminal ros2 run controller_manager spawner.py -h or ros2 run controller_manager spawner -h - This command is working in my case if it is so then change spawner.py to spawner in executable node.

Node(
            package="controller_manager",
            executable="spawner",   
            arguments=["joint_state_broadcaster", "--controller-manager", "/controller_manager"],
            ),
Node(
           package="controller_manager",
           executable="spawner",    
            arguments=["joint_trajectory_controller", "-c", "/controller_manager"],
            )

    You can check every thing is working by executing the command into your terminal:

ros2 topic pub /joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory "header:
  stamp:
    sec: 0
    nanosec: 0
  frame_id: ''
joint_names: ['joint_1','joint_2','joint_4']
points: [ {"positions":[-1.57,-0.59,-1.2]} ]"
